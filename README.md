# A Simple Rust IDE Prototype!

## Hello! ~ 👋
> My name is Lucas, I'm a Brazilian developer and I'm 14 years old. _(When I did the project)_

### This project is just a mini ide so I can show it to my future (maybe) employers!

##

> ## How it works?

### The entire code was written in Rust, using just a `crate` ***(library)***. The `terminal`.

#

### You can run this project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasFelixSilveira/ide.git # Clones the repository
cd ide # To access the cloned repository
cargo run # Compile and run the code

################################################
# Do you want to compile the program completely?
cargo build --release # Compile the repository

# In the `target/release` directory, you can find `lgvim.exe` (windows) or `lgvim` (Unix based systems).
# You must copy this executable and place it in a folder defined in your environment variables. (In the `path` field)
```

# Keybinds
### In file explorer:
- `X` Kill process 🚫
- `Backspace` Back one directory ↩️
- `Enter` Acess file or folder 🚪

### In editor
- `Escape` Exit file or back mode ❌
- `^S` Save file 📂
- `I` To insert mode 📝
- `M-X` To open command input 🟢
- `^G` To close command input 🔴


# Commands
- `Hi` Say Hello world! _(**Exemple command**)_
- `coop` Join or host a collaborative session. _(**Still not working.**)_

### This is one of my first public projects done in Rust. There will certainly be future changes.

### Thank you for your attention! I hope that you enjoyed.
