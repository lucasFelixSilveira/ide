# A Simple Rust IDE Prototype!

## Hello! ~ 👋
> My name is Lucas, I'm a Brazilian developer and I'm 14 years old. _(When I did the project)_

### This project is just a mini ide so I can show it to my future (maybe) employers!

##

> ## How it works?

### The entire code was written in Rust, using just two `crate`s ***(library)***. The `crossterm` and `colored`.

#

### You can run this project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasFelixSilveira/ide.git # Clones the repository
cd ide # To access the cloned repository
cargo run # Compile and run the code

################################################
# Do you want to compile the program completely?
cargo build --release # Compile the repository

# In the `target/release` directory, you can find `beditor.exe` (windows) or `beditor` (Unix based systems).
# You must copy this executable and place it in a folder defined in your environment variables. (In the `path` field)
```

# Keybinds
### In file explorer:
- `X` Kill process 🚫
- `Q` or `Backspace` Back one directory ↩️
- `E` or (`Enter`|`Space`) to acess file or folder 🚪
- `F` Acess `Properties` menu 📓

### In editor
- `L` Exit file 🚪
- `Escape` Return to **Movement** mode 🦶
- `^S` or `M-S` Save file 📂
- `I` To **Insert** mode 📝
- `M-Down` Move down a line of text ⬇
- `M-Up` Move up a line of text ⬆

### This is one of my first public projects done in Rust. There will certainly be future changes.

### Thank you for your attention! I hope that you enjoyed.
